Fluentd-Elasticsearch-Kibana with Docker, Container Discovery and DNS
=====================================================================

This example has serves a couples of different purpose (from my perspective):
  
   1. Learn and apply [docker.io](http://docker.io) in more detail
   2. Setup a (sort of) useful example leveraing some tools in the log analytics space
   3. Learn how to use [service discovery](https://github.com/crosbymichael/skydock) and [DNS](https://github.com/crosbymichael/skydns) with docker.io (I'm not a big fan of docker links)
   4. Understand how to do docker orchestration or rather how is should be done
